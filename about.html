    <h3 class="title">About</h3>
    <p class="description">Created by <a href="https://bkpleb.github.io">Bithiah. Was a cyber intelligence analyst at a small Tel-Aviv based company and found it tiring to continously search for OSINT data.
      Humphrey was designed to solve that problem for other intel analysts. The project is inspired by Humphrey Bogart, particularly from his role in <i>The Big Sleep (1946)</i>.
