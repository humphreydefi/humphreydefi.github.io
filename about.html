    <h3 class="title">About</h3>
    <p class="description">Created by <a href="https://bkpleb.github.io">Bithiah. Was a cyber intelligence analyst at a small Tel-Aviv based company and found it tiring to continously search for OSINT data.
      Humphrey was designed to solve that problem for other intel & blockchain analysts. The project is inspired by Humphrey Bogart, particularly from his role in <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-K49CUaeto">The Big Sleep</a>(1946)</i>.
